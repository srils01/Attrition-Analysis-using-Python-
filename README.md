# IBM _Attrition_analysis project
This project enabled me to uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore analysis of attrition considering various factors such as
Job role, gender, Department, Salary, Tenure in the company,etc.
This is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists.
I have wrriten the code using Python and presented attrition analysis with the dataset using graphs and charts.
User can choose the type of analysis he/she wants to see basis the input user enters. 
The insights will also be displayed on the graphs.
