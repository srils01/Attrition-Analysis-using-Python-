Summary
The goal of this project is to uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore important questions such as correlation between employee satisfaction and attritionâ€™ or comparing average monthly income by education and attrition. The attrition rate is typically calculated as the number of employees lost every year over the employee base. HR analytics is an up and coming area that can make HR departments in companies highly data-driven and improve their efficiency manifold. I used Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn packages to generate visualizations and sklearn package to gain insights into factors and trend lead to employee attrition.Through this kind of analysis, we can understand how many employees are likely to leave, while also determining which employees are at the highest risk and for what reasons.

Datasets
This is a fictional dataset created by IBM data scientists collected from Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset

This dataset has 35 features in total. We did Exploratory Data Analysis first by plotting the most possible features with respect to attrition to see the correlation.

Libraries used:

Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- HvPlot
- SciPy
- Sklearn
